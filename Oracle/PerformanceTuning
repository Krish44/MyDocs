Bind variables: 
Constants  - new execution plan each time data passsed
and literals -  single execution plan

Cursor sharing:
- specific private sql area
  -- Private dn shared sql area
  
  shared cursor
  - Parent dn Child cursor
  - Same query with letter macth, share same execution plan, same parent cursor
  
  V$%SQLAREA view - parent
  V$SQL
  
  Hard parse& soft parse
  Bind variable peeking
  Only during exe plan, data passed to bind variabnles wil be checked by optimiser
  
  Adaptive cursor sharing
  CURSOR_SHARING = {EXACT|}
  
  Adaptive cursor sharing
  - Cursor is place where execution plan is stored
  Cardinality of any where clause
  - First time always a hard parse
  - Bind sensitive (Optimal plan may depend on the value bind variables) 
  - Bind aware  Bind Sensitive cursor that is eligible to use different plans for different bind values
	- best plan for the current bind value 

 Cursor Merging:
 A bind aware cursor created by optimiser, if this plan is same a s existing cursor then optimiseer will
 perform cursor merging
 
 V$SQL - Bind sensitive ' aware
 V$SQL-CS_HISTOGRAM - distribution of
 V$SQL_CS_SELECTIVITY - 
 V$SQL_CS_STATISTICS - 
 
 BIND_AWARE and NO_BIND_AWARE hints
 - B.A - Will do adaptive cursor sharing
