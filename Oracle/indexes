Index columns and ponits where those rows are in the table
Find rows quickly

How to create indexes:
create index <index_name> on <table_name> ( <column1>, <column2>, â€¦ );
Ex: create index toys_color_i on toys ( color );

Oracle DB only indexes rows where atleast one column has a non null value.
If any row is null, that row doesnt appear on index

- Index is smaller data structure than tabl it's on.
- Advantage is they enbale to find a few rows quickly


Index structures:
- B tree:
	- Stores in tree structure. Each node is DB block

O(LOG (N)) : Order log N
